Probenecid is a uricosuric agent for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia and is also used to increase plasma concentrations of antibiotics. It is metaboliszed by UGT1A9, transported by OAT3 and renally excreted by glomerular filtration and subject of tubular reabsorbtion (GFR <1). About 72% to 86% of an oral dose of probenecid is excreted in urine and of this fraction only 0.3-5% are excreted unchanged. Probenecid is an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, UGT1A9, MRP4 (ABCC4) and OATP1B1 and can therefore serve as a perpetrator for these transporters in DDI studies. 

The herein presented PBPK model of probenecid has been developed using published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Dayton 1963 ([Dayton 1963](#5-references)), Emanuelsson 1987 ([Emanuelsson 1987](#5-references)), Vree 1992 ([Vree 1992](#5-references)), Selen 1982 ([Selen 1982](#5-references)), Wiebe 2020 ([Wiebe 2020](#5-references)) and Landersdorfer 2009 ([Landersdorfer 2009](#5-references)). 
The model has then been evaluated by comparing observed data to simulations of both intravenously and orally administered probenecid covering a dose range of 500 mg to 2000 mg. Both single dose and multiple dose administration are represented in the development and evaluation data sets. 

The presented model includes the following features:

- metabolism by UGT1A9,
- transport by OAT3,
- inhibition of OAT3, MRP4 (ABCC4) and OATP1B1,
- renal clearance by glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption modelled by GFR <1,
- oral absorption with dissolution rate assigned to the Weibull function.
