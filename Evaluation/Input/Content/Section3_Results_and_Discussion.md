The PBPK model for probenecid was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* single intravenous administration and both single and multiple oral administrations (tablets).
* a dose range of 250 to 2000 mg.

The model quantifies excretion via urine (glomerular filtration and reabsorption assigned to reduced GFR), metabolism via UGT1A9 and transport by OAT3.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-probenecid-final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-probenecid-diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-concentration-time-profiles).
