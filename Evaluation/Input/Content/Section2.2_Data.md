*To describe the competitive inhibition of MRP4 by probenecid, the corresponding inhibition constant was optimized during the furosemide PBPK model parameter identification, using the clinical data of one of the probenecid-furosemide interaction studies ([Probenecid-Furosemid-DDI Repository](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Probenecid-Furosemide-DDI)).

The following table shows the data from the excretion studies ([Vree 1992](#5-references)) used for model building:

| Observer                                                     | Value |

| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged probenecid after oral administration 1500 mg | 5%   |
| Fraction excreted  to urine of unchanged probenecid after oral administration 500 mg | 0.3%  |
