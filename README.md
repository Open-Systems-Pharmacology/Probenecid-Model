This repository contains:

- a [PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/importing-exporting-project-data-models#exporting-project-to-snapshot-loading-project-from-snapshot) of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases/latest).**



This probenecid model is intended to be used as perpetrator drug in OAT and OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).

This whole-body PBPK model of probenecid has been developed using published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Dayton 1963 [[1](#references)], Emanuelsson 1987 [[2](#references)], Vree 1992 [[3](#references)], Selen 1982 [[4](#references)], Wiebe 2020 [[5](#references)] and Landersdorfer 2009 [[6](#references)]. 
The model has then been evaluated by simulating clinical studies and comparing with respective observed data. 

The presented model includes the following features:

- metabolism by UGT1A9,
- transport by OAT3,
- inhibition of OAT and OATP1B1,
- renal clearance by glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption modelled by GFR <1,
- oral absorption with dissolution rate assigned to the Weibull function.

For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[7](#reference)]
